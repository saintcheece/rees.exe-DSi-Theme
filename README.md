# rees.exe-DSi-Theme
my personal DSi theme for the system's custom firmware TwilightMenu++ by RocketRobz. It modified the bootsplash, background, icons, and sfxs.

For **splashboot installation**, copy/move the contents from `Custom Splash\extras` to your SD Card's `[ROOT]\_nds\TWiLightMenu\extras\`

if you want to remove the DSi Shop Theme

For **theme installation**, copy/move the `rees.exe` folder to `[ROOT]\_nds\TWiLightMenu\dsimenu\themes\`

The theme is inspired by the Pip-Boy from the Fallout franchise and uses the fictional device's sound effects for navigation.

It also uses an [orchestral cover of the DSi shop by Jacob Shay](https://youtu.be/VZgXNPRJJPY?feature=shared) to fit the 50's style.

If you want to disable the music and only hear the white noises:
    1. Get rid of the initial `bgm.wav` you can do this by doing either of the following:
        - if you don't mind, delete it then move on to the next step.
        - if you might consider going back, rename it something else (eg: `old.wav`) then proceed to the next step.
    2. Rename the `humonlybgm.wav` to `bgm.wav`
