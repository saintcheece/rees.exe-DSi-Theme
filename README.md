# rees.exe-DSi-Theme
my personal DSi theme for the system's custom firmware [TwilightMenu++ by RocketRobz](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/). It modified the bootsplash, background, icons, and sfxs.

The theme is inspired by the Pip-Boy from the Fallout franchise and uses the fictional device's sound effects for navigation provided by the [resources uploaded by Inthegrave](https://www.sounds-resource.com/pc_computer/fallout3/sound/7029/).

It also uses an [orchestral cover of the DSi Shop by Jacob Shay](https://youtu.be/VZgXNPRJJPY?feature=shared) to fit the 50's style.

## Installation
For **theme installation**, copy/move the `rees.exe` folder to `[ROOT]\_nds\TWiLightMenu\dsimenu\themes\`

⚠️ NOTE: If you haven't already, enable the use of Custom Themes under GUI Settings.

For **splashboot installation**, copy/move the contents from `Custom Splash\extras` to your SD Card's `[ROOT]\_nds\TWiLightMenu\extras\`

⚠️ NOTE: If you haven't already, enable the use custom DSi Splash Screen under GUI Settings.

💡 TIP: For better results, change the system color under your DSi's System Settings to orange. 

## Modifications
If you want to disable the music and only hear the white noises:
1. Get rid of the initial `bgm.wav` you can do this by doing either of the following:
    - if you don't mind, delete it then move on to the next step.
    - if you might consider going back, rename it something else (eg: `old.wav`) then proceed to the    next step.
2. Rename the `humonlybgm.wav` to `bgm.wav`
